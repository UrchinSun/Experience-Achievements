# KSIX Project – Furnaces Filter System

**Company:** Verallia  
**Role:** Project Leader (Investment)  
**Duration:** 2 years  
**Focus:** Capital investment, ESG compliance, environmental engineering

## Description

A large-scale investment project to install a dedicated filtration system for two glass furnaces, designed to capture CO₂ emissions and dust particles in accordance with EU environmental standards. The solution also enabled reuse of filtered raw materials (dust) in production.

The project involved custom technical design, coordination with environmental authorities, construction, and seamless integration into the thermal system of the furnaces without halting operations.

### Key Responsibilities

- Developed tailored engineering solution and integrated it into existing systems  
- Aligned the project with EU ecological and ESG standards  
- Managed cross-team execution and contractor coordination  
- Oversaw full CAPEX planning and implementation, including permitting

## Achievements

1. Reduced particulate emissions by over 70% and decreased CO₂ via advanced filtration  
2. Enabled reuse of captured dust within the production cycle  
3. Obtained all required ecological and administrative approvals  
4. Integrated into 2 operational furnaces with zero production downtime  
5. Managed a $20M+ budget across design, construction, and commissioning  
6. Successfully passed all environmental audits  
7. Recognized under the company's ESG strategy as a sustainability milestone
